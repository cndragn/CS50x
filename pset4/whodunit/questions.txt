1.  stdint.h is a header file that provides a set of typedefs specifying exact-width integer types, 
    and mininimum and maximum allowad values for each type, using macros

2.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t functions are a cross-platform implementation of a standard 
    data type. uint8_t is an unsigned int of 8 bits, uint32_t is an unsigned long long, int32_t is a signed 
    long long, and a uint16_t is an unsigned 16 bit int.
	
3.  Byte is 8 bits, or 1 byte
    DWORD is 32 bits ,or 4 bytes
    LONG is 32 bits, or 4 bytes
    WORD is 16 bits or 2 bytes
	
4.  The first two bytes of a BMP is WORD and denotes bfType, which specifies the file type. 
    Hex: 0x424d, 42 and 4d are the first two bytes. ASCII: BM for bitmap.

5.  bfSize specifies the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
	biSize specifies the size of the structure in bytes.
	
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap flips the DIB (also called bitmapinfo header) so its origin is
    the top left corner instead of bottom left.
	
7.  biBitCount in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)

8.  fopen will return NULL if it cannot create the outfile to write to.
    This can happen if the file is Read-Only or Write Protected.
    
9.  The third argument in fread is always 1 because that is the amount of elements to be read.

10. Padding is assigned if the bi-biWiedth is 3 to bring the width up to a multiple of 4
    3 bits of pixel only come to 9 byes, the pdding brings it to 12 bytes.

11. Skips over padding to the next RGB triple

12. SEEK_CUR is the current position of the pointer that fseek uses to as an indicator to know 
    where to start searching from
